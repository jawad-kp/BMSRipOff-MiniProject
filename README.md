# BMSRipOff-MiniProject
This is an open source Movie booking and management software by Jawad Khan and Gaurav Yalamuri from SJBIT, Bangalore. It's designed in two primary parts:
1) The User side
2) The Admin side

The User Side lets a user; view movies available, book them by selecting their seats and time and then finally see their bookings

The Admin side allows a site admin to easily add movies, shows, manage bookings and screens and also make any deletions they see fit in a GUI. The intention was to make a simply Movie booking site more accessible to any user who wishes to deploy it.

The project has also fulfilled all of the VTU's Mini-Project Requirements for DBMS, including and not limited to having at the very least five entities, one trigger and a one procedure on the backend, apart from a usbale Front-End. The Project is made using Bootstrap, so it should scale to nearly any screen and has been mostly checked for any flaws on that end.
